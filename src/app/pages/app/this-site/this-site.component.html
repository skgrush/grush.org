<h1>Grush.org, this website</h1>

<p>
  My personal website for talking about my dev work
  and other such stuff.
</p>
<p>
  Written in Angular 19 zoneless, with SSG â€” Server-side generation, meaning each route
  is generated to its own <code>index.html</code> in the appropriate
  file path, and when it is rendered in the browser the Angular runtime
  "hydrates" the page.
  One benefit of SSG is there's no layout flash since the layout comes with
  the HTML from the server. Another is that almost the entire site works without
  JS enabled! Only the GitHub repo integrations require JS.
