<h1>About me</h1>

<p>Hai I'm Sam. This is my website. I do code stuff.</p>

<p>
  I've been codin' poorly since circa 2010
  and codin' good since at least 2016.
</p>

  I started out with <mark>PHP</mark>, which I've come to hate
  (not as bad with a good framework)
  but taught me a lot about dynamic languages and
  also hacking up those languages in ways they
  were never intended to be.
  Next I inevitably fell into writing raw <mark>JS/HTML/CSS</mark>
  which I found to be very powerful but inherently hacky
  — a great connection to PHP.
</p>

<p>
  I spent the next 5 years thinking <mark>Python</mark> was the best
  thing since array slicing. Still I continued writing <mark>vanilla JS and PHP</mark>.
</p>
<img alt="TypeScript logo" src="/media/ts-logo-256.svg" id="ts-logo" class="lang-logo">
<p>
  In 2017 I was finally exposed in a student job to <mark>React and TypeScript</mark> which
  changed web development for me and I've been in love with <mark>TypeScript</mark>
  ever since — React not so much. Most all of my personal projects from here
  on are written in TypeScript, though I've rarely worked on any applications
  that were not web apps.

  In 2019 I started working full-time on a <mark>.NET Core</mark> job and found the platform to
  be extremely satisfying to use — many of the benefits of Java but feels better-paced at
  staying modern with new language features, functionality, compilation, etc.
  This led to <mark>Angular</mark>, which I also find especially satisfying for many of the same reasons.
